### üìå About Us

**SpeedyLabX** was founded by a passionate group of undergraduate AI majors at FPT University. Operating under the mentorship of **Ms. Minh Th∆∞**, our group aims to cultivate a research-driven mindset while building practical, impactful projects that bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world application.

Our core interests include:
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** From classical algorithms to advanced neural networks.  
- **Data Science & Analytics:** Extracting meaningful insights from complex data.  
- **Applied & Academic AI Research:** Conducting structured research aimed at publication.

### üéØ Our Mission

> To explore, experiment, and contribute to the AI landscape through disciplined research and real-world applications ‚Äî fostering both individual growth and collective innovation.
